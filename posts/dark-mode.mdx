Dark mode has gained a humongous following. It has become an expected feature of all websites, native apps, and operating systems.
The reasons for this are not that hard to understand. It lessens that intrusive feeling of blue light entering your retinas from
a glowing screen late at night, or even during the day. 

If you were directed here by the little note that appears at the bottom of my posts when viewed in dark mode, you might think 
that I'm deeply prejudiced against dark mode. I'm far from it. If you want to use dark mode, I think that is perfectly fine.
It's just important to question the worth of dark mode, and to examine the impact it has on your relationship with devices.

Unfortunately, the research on these topics is sparse. Here's what I could put together.

## Measurable harm

Maybe you've read this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-need-dark-mode/) about the dubious reality of 
dark mode's benefits. If not, I'll summarise it as best as I can. The thrust of the argument is that humans evolved to
distinguish dark things on light backgrounds, instead of the opposite, meaning that dark on light is optimal for comprehension.
This argument has some notable experimental backing in a few pieces of research.

[Piepenbrock et al. (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2013.790485)
found significant advantages to dark text on a light background in proofreading and visual acuity.  [Wang et al. (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169814103000416)
found advantages in reading speed when light backgrounds with high contrast foreground text was used. 
[Buchner & Baumgartner (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00140130701306413) measured better performance in proofreading, 
and a lower incidence in headaches and eyestrain. 

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention contradictory research such as 
[Kim et al (2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3357251.3357584) which suggests the opposite — they found improved 
visual accuity in the case of light information on a dark background. Meanwhile [Pedersen et al. (2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-49282-3_13)
concluded there was no meaningful effect on productivity and [Wang & Chen (2000)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169814199000402) found
no meaningful effect on accuity. 

These differences in measured impact of dark mode, which range from significant to nonexistent are tricky to reckon with.
One potential explanation comes from [Buchner et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00140130802641635). This study finds that the 
differences between dark and light mode are actually differences of display luminance. In other words, brighter screens lead to higher
acuity, and light mode leads to brighter screens. Another study in which Buchner participated, the previously mentioned 
[Buchner & Baumgartner (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00140130701306413), suggests that individuals may automatically 
increase the effort they put into tasks when they are presented with light text on a dark background. This would further 
muddy results for or against dark mode.

That was a lot of studies all at once, so let's summarise and interpret. Studies have found both significant advantages and no advantages
at all to light mode. However, the fact that luminance seems to override differences between dark and light mode pulls things into focus. The reason why light mode
is often measurably better is that light mode is often measurably *lighter*. In addition, because the most positive case for dark mode seems to be a lack of impact,
and the worst case is a decrease in accuity and comprehension, I'd say that the science still points against the use of dark mode.

There's also the meaningful detail that the switch to light mode was a conscious decision made as it became technologically possible.
All computers used to display text on a dark background. The first computers doing the opposite appeared in the early 80s with the adoption
of LCD technology. CRT displays retained their dominance until about the 2000s. Once LCDs gained dominance, their signature white backgrounds
stuck around for many years. I do not think this was simply a matter of technological convenience. The light background may not have
been strongly preferred, but I doubt it was maligned either. The same professionals went from dark to light backgrounds, and 
had no issue whatsoever. Dark mode is not a revolution in UI design, it's a design trend.

## Harm to the self

This is perhaps where my argument against dark mode becomes harder to buy into, so I'd like to start it with something
relatively quantitive. [Löffler et al. (2017)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67684-5_12) found that dark
mode led to individuals being more likely to perceive chat messages on Twitch.tv as having negative sentiment.
Of course, this is just a study on Twitch. Yet the rather reasonable assumption that this indicates a wider impact
could lead one to believe that dark mode has negative mental impacts.

In addition, exiting the realm of science, I believe dark mode harms the manner in which one approaches their devices. 
The discomfort that some experience with light mode — stemming from the unnatural nature of the light that computer screens 
emit — is natural and good. Much like books, or sheet music, or architectural schematics, computers should not 
be comfortable to look at in a dark room. If it's getting uncomfortable to keep working late into the night, that is 
your brain telling you that you it's time to stop working.  

Further, discomfort is an inherent part of doing work. Metalworkers do not expect the welding torch to be safe to look at, 
fishermen do not expect waves to be kind to them, and public speakers do not expect the audience to encourage them. 
These comparisons may seem dramatic, and maybe they are, but computers let one eliminate discomfort to an unprecedented degree. 
Discomfort should be inherent to work, because it keeps you focused. It forces you to evaluate if the work you're doing 
is worth it.

I also believe that dark mode is even more harmful in the context of social media. It is very dangerous to allow social media platforms
to become somewhere comfortable, cozy, and dark. The discomfort, or even eyestrain, of light mode is 
good. If your screen blinds you late at night without dark mode, that's a signal that it's time to stop using screens. If
you begin to feel eyestrain as you work in the day, that's your body telling you that it's time to give your eyes a break 
and look at something in the distance for a few minutes.

Dark mode doesn't make looking at a screen for most of your day less damaging, nor does it make looking at one right before
you sleep less damaging. All it does is cloud the signals your body is sending you
behind an artificial layer of comfort and coziness.
