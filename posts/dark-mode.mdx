Dark mode has gained a humongous following. It has become an expected feature of all websites, native apps, and operating systems.
The reasons for this are not that hard to understand. It lessens that intrusive feeling of blue light entering your retinas from
a glowing screen late at night, or even during the day. 

If you were directed here by the little note that appears at the bottom of my posts when viewed in dark mode, you might think 
that I'm deeply prejudiced against dark mode. But I'm far from it. If you want to use dark mode, I think that is perfectly fine.
I just think that it's worth it for me to present my argument againt dark mode, and for you to consider it if you take a healthy
relationship with devices seriously.

Unfortunately, the research on these topics is sparse. Here's what I could put together.

## Measurable harm

Maybe you've read this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/do-you-need-dark-mode/) about the dubious reality of 
dark mode's benefits. If not, I'll summarise it as best as I can. The thrust of the argument is that humans evolved to
distinguish dark things on light backgrounds, instead of the opposite, meaning that dark on light is optimal for comprehension.


[Piepenbrock et al. (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2013.790485)
found significant advantages to dark text on a light background in proofreading and visual acuity.  [Wang et al. (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169814103000416)
found advantages in reading speed when light backgrounds with high contrast foreground text was used. 
[Buchner & Baumgartner (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00140130701306413) measured better performance in proofreading, 
and a lower incidence in headaches and eyestrain. They further argue that it is possible that the inability of some studies
to find a meaningful difference between dark and light mode may be due to individuals automatically increasing their levels
of effort to make up for the challenges dark mode could provide to legibility.

Of course, a single WIRED article is not definitive proof. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention contradictory research such as 
[Kim et al (2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3357251.3357584) which suggests the opposite — they found improved 
visual accuity in the case of light information on a dark background. Meanwhile [Pedersen et al. (2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-49282-3_13)
concluded there was no meaningful effect on productivity and [Wang & Chen (2000)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169814199000402) found
no meaningful effect on accuity. 

There's also the meaningful detail that the switch to light mode was a conscious decision made as it became technologically possible.
All computers used to display text on a dark background. The first computers doing the opposite appeared in the early 80s with the adoption
of LCD technology. However, CRT displays retained their dominance for far longer. Once LCDs gained dominance, their signature white backgrounds
stuck around for many years. I do not think this was simply a matter of technological convenience. The light background may not have
been strongly preferred, but I doubt it was maligned either. 

These differences in measured performance impact of dark mode, ranging from significant to nonexistent are tricky to reckon with.
One potential explanation comes from [Buchner et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00140130802641635). This study finds that the 
differences between dark and light mode are actually differences of display luminance. In other words, brighter screens lead to higher
acuity, and light mode leads to brighter screens.

That was a lot of studies all at once, so let's summarise and interpret. Studies have found both significant advantages and no advantages
at all to light mode. The research is so contradictory that it's material for a stand-up comedy joke about scientists. However, the 
fact that luminance seems to override differences between dark and light mode pulls things into focus. The reason why light mode
is often measurably better is that light mode is often measurably *lighter*. 

## Mental harm

This is perhaps where my argument against dark mode becomes harder to buy into, so I'd like to start it with something
relatively quantitive. [Löffler et al. (2017)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67684-5_12) found that dark
mode led to individuals being significantly more likely to perceive chat messages on Twitch.tv as having negative sentiment.
Of course, this is just a study on Twitch. Yet the entirely reasonable assumption that this indicates a wider effect of 
dark mode on how one perceives sentiment online would mean that using dark mode makes the internet appear to genuinely be a 
more toxic and hostile place.   

However, beyond this concern, I think there is more to worry about with the prevalence of dark mode. I'm going to exit 
the realm of science here to discuss the manner in which one should approach their devices. The discomfort that
some experience with light mode — stemming from the unnatural nature of the light that computer screens emit — is natural. 
Computers should not be as comfortable to look at as a dark room. The discomfort inherent in using a computer late at night
is a good thing. 

Discomfort is an important part of doing good work. It keeps you focused, and motivates you to get finished instead of wading
about in inaction. Metalworkers do not expect their welding torch to cool down for them, fishermen do not expect waves 
to be kind to them, and public speakers do not expect the audience to encourage them. These comparisons may seem dramatic, 
and maybe they are. However, the point is not how much pressure the work puts you under. The point is that there is 
discomfort inherent to every kind of work. Computers allow those who work on them to eliminate an unprecedented amount of 
this discomfort, including dark mode. 

Resist the desire. Let being on a device be uncomfortable to some degree, even a tiny one. It discourages frivolous and excessive use. 
If you *really* need to be on a computer, your reasons should be sufficient motivation to deal with it. 
Dark mode does little but encourage mindless scrolling, endless watching, and invented excuses to use computers.
