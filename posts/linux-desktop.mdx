## Introduction

"The year of the Linux desktop" has been a common refrain of the Linux community for a while now. Every once in a while there's a post proclaiming that **this is the year**. That statement has a very bad track record:

- [2004: The year of desktop Linux?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/2004-the-year-of-desktop-linux/)
- [2008: Linux's year on the desktop ](https://www.zdnet.com/article/2008-linuxs-year-on-the-desktop/)
- [2009 is the Year of GNU/Linux on the Desktop](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/2009-year-gnulinux-desktop/)
- [Is 2017 the Year of the Linux Desktop?](https://www.datamation.com/open-source/is-2017-the-year-of-the-linux-desktop/)
- [Will 2018 Be the Year of the Linux Desktop](https://www.maketecheasier.com/will-2018-be-the-year-of-linux-desktop/)
- [2019 is the year of Linux on the desktop](https://www.howtogeek.com/414036/2019-is-the-year-of-linux-on-the-desktop/)
- [2021 Is the Year of Linux on the Desktop](https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/2021-is-the-year-of-linux-on-the-desktop)
- [2022 - The Year of the Linux Desktop](https://jamesachambers.com/2022-the-year-of-the-linux-desktop/)

For this reason, the Linux community has started claiming that its an inside joke. There's even [a website](https://yotld.com/) which counts down to the year of the Linux desktop - perpetually next year. This facade of irony lasts until something like the Steam Deck comes around, and then discussion about a "year of the Linux desktop" resumes with no hint of irony. I am sympathetic to this idea. It holds some sway over even me, as someone typing this post from a desktop running Fedora 37. Its a sentiment which comes from a lack of understanding. Why would so many users stick with their *clearly inferior* operating systems? It's the same sentiment which leads to user blaming - the idea that people don't use Linux because they're stuck in their ways from years of Windows or MacOS usage. If that was the case though, the Windows market share would not be decreasing rapidly.

I believe the Linux community is entirely out of touch with the reality of the common computer user. Linux is not "easy". I've used a pretty sizeable portion of popular distros (Mint, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, Pop!, Void, etc) and pretty much every popular desktop environment and window manager. I love Linux on the desktop. However, across every distro and DE I've tried, I see common issues that would deter regular users.

## Package management and proprietary software

This is a big one. The Linux community cannot for the love of god figure out how to distribute software. Package managers are a pretty common cited benefit of Linux, but in reality their benefits only come into play if the things you're installing are either FOSS, very common, or development libraries/CLI tools. 

### Software distribution

If you ask any regular human being to run this:
``` 
curl -sS https://download.spotify.com/debian/pubkey_7A3A762FAFD4A51F.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/spotify.gpg
echo "deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install spotify-client
```

before they can install Spotify, they will not be happy. The reason why MacOS and Windows are so usable to most people is not solely due to the advantage they gained through early adoption. Those operating systems allow the user to build a working model of what they are actually doing to achieve some goal, even if it's extremely innacurate, and then apply that model widely.

On MacOS, to install a program I drop the icon into the Applications folder. Is that really what's happening? No! Of course not! But the users don't care. On Windows, I run a file which opens a window with some next buttons, I click them all, and then the application is installed. Does this accurately represent all the steps involved in installing a Windows program? No! Not at all! ***The users don't care.*** 

They don't care because they have a model of how software is installed. On Windows, there's an installer. On MacOS, there's the icon drag and drop. With the introduction of the Microsoft Store and App Store on the Mac, some adjustment has been required, but those stores are so simple that it doesn't really matter. You just click the button.

Linux has no such equivalent. It's incredibly difficult to build conceptual understanding without technical understanding. Even within the "intuitive" software style apps there's confusion.

What is a flatpak? What is an RPM? What is the difference between dl.flathub.org, and registry.fedoraproject.org? What functional difference is there between these installation options? 

I know, and if you're reading this you probably do too. But my mom doesn't. My friends don't. And the missing knowledge required to actually understand what a Flatpak is or why it's important is really huge. What if someone wants to install custom cursors, but half of their applications are Flatpaks? 


They won't go: 
> Ah yes, the ingenious sandboxing of this software packaging and distribution utility has clearly prevented my applications from accessing device settings such as cursors by default.
>
> -- *Some fucking nerd*

Instead, they'll think it's dumb that their application doesn't respect settings that should be system wide (like cursors) due to a solution to a problem that shouldn't exist and they don't even know exists. And they would be right.

And then, there's AppImages. I don't need to say much on AppImages. Functionally useless to the average user without [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher). Guess what one needs to do to install AppImageLauncher? 

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install appimagelauncher
```

More commands that are incomprehensible to the average user - and a utility most won't realise exists.

I want to bring it back to the first example I gave of the Spotify installation. Let's go through the questions someone unfamiliar with Linux/programming would have to ask in order to build even *the most basic* model of the software ecosystem they exist in.
1. What is curl?
2. What is gpg?
3. Why is gpg needed?
4. What is an apt repository?
5. What is apt?

None of this should be necessary to know, but if you plan to install anything slightly uncommon and want to understand what is being done when you install it (which people do), it becomes necessary to know. The level of abstraction on Linux is often too low - and falls apart as soon as you exit the curated software experience. That curated software experience is *extremely* limited in scope.

### Software people actually want

The unfortunate reality is that the software on Linux available for creative and professional work simply does not compete. The Adobe Creative Cloud is vast, and GIMP is not an alternative to Photoshop, no matter how hard Redditors will try to convince you it is. Video editing is a real sore spot. The best alternative is probably [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/), which is... an option. Or you can use a version of Davinci Resolve so limited it might as well not exist. Last I checked it didn't have H.264/265 support. Yikes. Want an After Effects alternative? Too bad!

Microsoft 365 alternatives have more coverage, but it's generally the same story. Less features, less usable, less compatible.

The unfortunate reality regardless, is that people want to use the software they know. ***They don't care*** if (big if) they can get the same results once they learn new software. ***They don't care*** about the ideology of free software. They aren't invested in Linux.

## The experience of switching to Linux

In addition, actually switching to Linux is far from an easy task for most people. The barriers to entry are high.

### Installing a distro

The first challenge any prospective Linux user has to overcome is distro selection. Once someone has figured out this is even a necessary step, they can find countless articles on the topic, recommending distros from Ubuntu to MX. The distro selection process is a *pain* from the perspective of a new user, as demonstrated in the first part of the [LTT Linux series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0506yDSgU7M&t=5s). Before you blame Linus for this difficulty - remember that he's a tech-savvy guy. If he struggled with it, what chance do most users have? Distros usually have similar reported advantages, but few drawbacks are comprehensible to any user. What user is going to comprehend the reliance of Ubuntu on snaps? Or the way in which Linux Mint blocks them? What user will understand that Arch updates frequently, or that Debian updates rarely? Or even why any of this is important?

USB flashing is also a huge barrier. How many of the people you've met do you think have ***ever*** opened the boot device selection menu of their BIOS? Probably less have flashed a USB, and less still have actually combined them to do something besides Windows recovery.

I think it's important to remember that most people struggle to open Task Manager to close a background process - let alone install a Linux distribution.

### Desktop environments 

On the whole, they aren't satisfactory. They all generally have some combination of:
1. Insane defaults
2. Aesthetic problems
3. Friction using software from other GUI toolkits
4. General usability issues

For anyone switching to Linux, we can rule out i3 and friends as too technical and strange. 

We're left with KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, LXDE, and LXQT as our main options. Everything after Cinnamon can be ruled out (issue 2 and 4). The work they do to be runnable on anything is nice, but most people either do not have hardware constraints or do not realize that they do. Try and explain the hardware limitations of a dual core 2015 Macbook Air to its user and you'll probably get lack of understanding or complete defensiveness. People generally don't want to use ugly UIs, even if they run better.

From our reduced pool, vanilla GNOME can be eliminated. The workflow is too distant from anything familiar, and is unusable unless you're willing to memorise dozens of keybinds. I personally use a heavily modified GNOME install, but the average user is not willing to do that. 

To me that leaves KDE, precustomised GNOME (Ubuntu and Pop!), and Cinnamon. KDE and Cinnamon to attract Windows users, and GNOME to attract... MacOS users?. There's some jankiness across all 3, which I suppose is to be expected. Cinnamon is a throwback to 2012 out of the box, GNOME has its strange GNOME quirks, and KDE is just... visually busy. I have not used an uncustomised DE in years not just because I like customisation, but because in my opinion all DEs require it to match Windows and MacOS in usability and aesthetics.

## Can we pick a technology please?

Linux on the desktop is currently quite fragmented. GTK4 is pulling further away from being a cross platform toolkit, Qt is very heavyweight - and is a commerical product with free use dependent on licensing your code under LGPL3 or GPL3. Pipewire and Pulseaudio are a constant sore spot, as are X11 and Wayland. Snap vs Flatpak is a perpetual source of annoying "free as in beer" quotes.

The work done by [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org) to standardise everything from basic directory locations to icon theming was incredible, and hugely important. We need another round of standardisation. The Linux desktop needs to recombine into a common front, working on common feature implementation. Once we've done that, we can create a base platform for Linux apps and DEs. As [Havoc Pennington](https://www.osnews.com/story/4521/) put it back in 2003:

> If we can negotiate the scary political waters, I’d like to see the various X projects, freedesktop.org, and the desktop environments and applications work together on a single base desktop platform project.

## Conclusion

The core of the problem is - stick with me here - an inherent challenge of community organised open source projects. The people who work on Linux and its ecosystem are developers. They mostly get feedback from developers. As projects without a goal of profit, there is no consumer facing product development. 

We keep sticking cool tech onto Linux and assuming that at some point we'll have enough that users will switch over. Modern day Linux has some incredibly cool technology behind it. btrfs is amazing - if unfinished, Systemd is shockingly powerful, and the default paradigm of package managers has ridiculous potential. But ***users dont care***. When was the last time you heard a MacOS vs Windows argument which compared idle RAM usage, or the benefits of representing devices as files? 

And of course, as developers some things seem obvious to us - necessary even. Of course the software store should let you pick from any valid installation source. Why on Earth would anyone want less choice? We exist in a bubble of developers and techies, in which cool stuff that we like gets built. This is a lot of fun, but it's not a recipe for a Linux desktop takeover. 

***If we really want Linux on the desktop to become reality, it cannot be like this anymore. A focused effort is needed to actually build an operating system for consumers.***
