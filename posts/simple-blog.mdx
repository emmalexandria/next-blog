## Introduction
I shudder thinking of the amount of developer time spent on building developer blogs. They're seemingly endless. Blogs with page transitions,
tag indexes, tag filters, and whatever else the developer thought would be 'cool'. I understand that. 
I used to have one myself. It had page transitions, a gallery of my photography, all the tag features, a word counter, etc.

I spent months on that site. It went through three redesigns, and many feature additions. Then I threw it out. It hurt to do. I'd like to give you my reasoning.

## Why

### Respect for my time
I had spent so long building up this blog but I wasn't actually *writing anything*. I was always tweaking.
Tweaking the design, the spacing, the colours. Why? Because I was always seeing minor flaws and always getting bored.
I think this is true of a lot of developers. Blog projects get started because everyone else has one. Then they remain in a constant state of flux with no content. 
Maybe they'll have some tutorials put up. 

It's ultimately pointless. Making a blog is a good exercise in developing a website, but don't make it your blog unless you plan to blog. Get the blog
finished, and then *write*.

### Respect for the reader
The purpose of a blog is to be read. It should be the most boring site you develop.
No animations, no wacky colour schemes, and no clutter, especially on the page that renders your posts. 

The internet is filled with endless disrespect for ones time. Everything is trying to pull your attention. 
Advertisements, branding, social features, and complex designs all combine into an endless noisy mess. There's no reason for 
your blog to do the same. If someone visits your blog, they likely intend to read. If so, respect that intention. 
Build a site thats as readable as possible.

If you feel some need for a complicated blog, ask  yourself why. If it's to sell yourself or your skills, make a portfolio.

## Building a better blog

### Design for reading
Keep it simple. Create a clear typographical hierarchy. Choose one accent colour and use it sparingly. 
Try to emulate printed text in your use of background and foreground colours.
Keep the length of your lines short, and use the free space on either side as free space. No sidebars, no fancy table of contents,
no social links. 

Give the reader space to breathe and easy to comprehend typography. Interrogate every new addition to the design harshly.

### Add features sparingly
How many people do you think actually want to see everything you've ever written about an arbitrarily defined tag denoting some topic? 
How many people want to see every single arbitrarily defined topic you've ever written about? Does your blog even have enough readers to 
justify an RSS feed? Be realistic. All these features do is create confusion.

### Content
Be clear and concise. Short sentences, simple words, and write things with value. Basically, don't waffle. Say what you need to say.

If you're writing a guide, don't paste in 50 line code snippets. Break it up and explain what you're doing. 

## Conclusion
These blogs are an ingrained part of web development culture, so I doubt many will agree with me. I hope it was an interesting
perspective to hear at least.
