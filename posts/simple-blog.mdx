## Introduction
I shudder thinking of the amount of developer time spent on building developer blogs. They're seemingly endless. Blogs with page transitions,
tag indexes, tag filters, and whatever else the developer thought would be 'cool'. I understand that. 
I used to have one myself. It had page transitions, a gallery of my photography, all the tag features, a word counter, etc.

I spent months on that site. It went through three redesigns, and many feature additions. Then I threw it out. It hurt to do. I'd like to give you my reasoning.

## The why

### Respect for my time
I had spent so long building up this blog but I wasn't actually *writing anything*. I was always tweaking.
Tweaking the design, the spacing, the colours. Why? Because I was always seeing minor flaws and always getting bored.
I think this is true of a lot of developers. Blog projects get started because everyone else has one. Then they become a drain of time.
The blog site becomes the focus, because the developer doesn't actually want a blog.
Maybe they'll have some tutorials put up, but besides that it becomes a showpiece that makes every piece of content on it
challenging to read.

It's ultimately pointless. Making a blog is a good exercise in developing a website, but don't make it your blog unless you plan to blog. Get the blog
finished, and then *write*.

### Respect for the reader
The purpose of a blog is to be read. It should be the most boring site you develop.
No animations, no wacky colour schemes, and no clutter, especially on the page that displays your posts. 

The internet is filled with blatant disrespect for one's time. Everything is pulling your attention away from what matters. 
Advertisements, branding, social features, spam, and complex designs combine into a hydra of distraction. I'm sure you've experienced
this, as has everyone who has used the internet. If you have, you know how obnoxious it is. There's no reason for 
your blog to do the same. If someone visits your blog, they likely intend to read. If so, respect that intention. Respect that
they decided to read what you have written and build a site that facilitates their choice.

If you feel some need for a complicated blog, ask  yourself why. If it's to sell yourself or your skills, make a portfolio.

## Building a better blog

### Design for reading
Keep it simple. Create a clear typographical hierarchy. Choose one accent colour and use it sparingly. 
Try to emulate printed text in your use of background and foreground colours.
Keep the length of your lines short, and use the free space on either side as free space. No sidebars, no fancy table of contents,
no social links. 

Give the reader space to breathe and easy to comprehend typography. Interrogate every new addition to the design harshly.

### Add features sparingly
How many people do you think actually want to see everything you've ever written about an arbitrarily defined tag denoting some topic? 
How many people want to see every single arbitrarily defined topic you've ever written about? Does your blog even have enough readers to 
justify an RSS feed? Why is your blog list paginated when you have less than 100 posts? Be realistic. Unecessary features create
unecessary confusion. Add these things if and when they become necessary.

### Hide the technology
It doesn't matter what you use to build your blog. Astro, Next, Sveltekit, Hugo, etc are all fine. What matters is that
you never let the technology goad you into cluttering your site. Nuxt has great support for page transitions,
but that doesn't mean you should use them. Sveltekit has the same for per element transitions, but don't use them either.
Nobody who is reading your blog cares what you built it in. 

HTML is great at making lists of readable documents. That's what it was designed to do. Be wary of straying
from what HTML and CSS alone can do. What matters is that your site is fast, readable, and accessible, not beautiful. These frameworks have these features
so that they can be used when they are appropriate, not so that they can be used in every scenario.

### Content
Be clear and concise. Short sentences, simple words, and write things with value. Basically, don't waffle. Say what you need to say.

If you're writing a guide, don't paste in 50 line code snippets. Break it up and explain what you're doing. 

## A better internet
This piece of writing focuses on blogs. I suppose that's because blogs show the most flagrant disrespect of their visitors 
that I've seen. However, it's not just about blogs. It's about the internet. The further we get from plain HTML,
the harder developers have to work to ensure their sites are fast and accessible. The classic joke pointing 
this out is [motherfuckingwebsite.com](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).

Developer blogs are such an important part of how developers learn to create websites. Often, it's the first project that
an aspiring web developer will architect and build on their own. That is why I am rallying 
against them specifically. Maybe if the culture around them shifts, the web will too. That might be too
optimistic, but that is my hope. 

The internet is clearly in a bad way. Sites which blatantly steal content
appear above their original sources, every site has an obnoxious anti-user cookies popup, ads are simultaneously getting
more intrusive and better disguised across every platform, and accessibility has stagnated. [Over 96.3% of the top million websites this year had accessibility failures under WCAG 2.](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)
If that doesn't upset you, I think you need to do some reflection. This site has none, because it's simple and structured. Your site should have none too.

The internet should be better. We should be better. Start with your blog.
